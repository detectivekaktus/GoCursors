# gocursors
***WARNING! THIS PROJECT IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS. DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM IT.***
gocursors is an ncurses-like library written in Go for everyone who's tired of absurdly complex workflows, rules and interfaces that other popular Go TUI libraries have. It's important to notice that gocursors is not the copy of ncurses with Go syntax but rather is a library inspired by ncurses and its simplicity.

If you have never used ncurses library or have never heard of it, check out [this on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses).
